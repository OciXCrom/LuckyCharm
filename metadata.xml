    <description>Adds a trinket in the game named Lucky Charm that has a 2% chance to turn [b]any[/b] coin drop into a lucky penny.

This synergizes well with items that spawn coins, such as IV Bag, Head of the Keeper, Wooden Nickel, etc.

The trinket is unavailable until you unlock lucky pennies by donating 1 coin to the Greed Donation Machine. </description>
